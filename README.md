ABOUT BTEUP
State Board of Technical Education and Training was set up in the state in May,1958. The Board conducted its first examination in 1960, for courses of diploma level and also for Draughtsman Certificate Course. The name of the state Board was changed to Board of Technical Education in 1962. In the same Year, the U.P. Pravidhic Shiksha Adhiniyam - 1962 was enacted awarding the Board statutory status. In the year 1962, year of its inception, the Board held the examination of about 2500 students, in three major disciplines of Civil, Electrical and Mechanical Engineering at 25 different Centers/Institutions. It has a chairman, vice-chairman and 40 members, named by the state government. Secretary, Board of Technical Education, U.P. is ex-officio member secretary of the Board. The curriculum prepared by other institutions was adopted by the Board, till 1980 but thereafter the curriculum and syllabi were developed and revised, every five years at the Board level through its Curriculum development cell. The curriculum development work has been entrusted to I.R.D.T. Kanpur. The Board now examine and approve the syllabus developed by IRDT, Kanpur and prescribe it for institutions affiliated to Board of Technical Education, U.P. About 1,05,000 students in the 60 different disciplines of one year, two year, three year and four year durations are being examined at present, in the institutions, affiliated to the Board. The Board of has been constituted under U.P. Pravidhic Shiksha Adhiniyam - 1962. It has a Chairman and a Vice-Chairman and, 40 memebers nominated by the state Government. Secretary, Board of Technical Education is ex-officio member secretary of the Board.
SUMMER TRAINING
Summer training is an important part of the engineering curriculum. The summer training helps a student in getting acquainted with the manner in which his/her knowledge is being practically used outside his/her institute and this is normally different from what he/she has learnt from books. Hence, when the student switches from the process of learning to that of implementing his/her knowledge, he/she finds an abrupt change. This is exactly why summer training session during the B.T.E curriculum becomes all the more important. Summer training is prescribed for the student of Technical College as a part of the four-year degree course of engineering by the AICTE. We are required to undergo summer training for a period of 45 days after the completion of the 2nd year. 
Summer Training allows industry exposure and understanding the working environment & it gives the industrial exposure. It is essential and helps to attain in-depth knowledge of the engineering stream. It enhances professional skills in a real-time environment. It helps us understand the area of interest and selection of an area of specialization. It also allows students to learn the basics of how to work as a team member to complete given tasks. It improves awareness of the industrial environment and work culture of the specific industry. It gives real-time work and the projects help to learn more analytically. It allows interaction with experts to solve queries with practical exposure. The Certificate obtained from a reputed organization gives weightage to resume or CV.
TECHNOLOGIES TRAINED ON DURING SUMMER TRAINING
1.	HTML: - HTML is stand for hypertext markup language, this markup language is used to design static web pages. HTML contain pre-defined tags, which are useful to design web pages. HTML describes the structure of a Web page. HTML consists of a series of elements. HTML elements tell the browser how to display the content. HTML elements label pieces of content such as "this is a heading", "this is a paragraph", "this is a link", etc.
2.	CSS: - CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets. CSS describes how HTML elements are to be displayed on screen, paper, or in other media.CSS is the language we use to style an HTML document. CSS describes how HTML elements should be displayed. CSS saves a lot of work. It can control the layout of multiple web pages all at once. External stylesheets are stored in CSS files.
3.	Javascript: -  JavaScript is a scripting or programming language that allows you to implement complex features on web pages — every time a web page does more than just sit there and display static information for you to look at — displaying timely content updates, interactive maps, animated 2D/3D graphics, scrolling video jukeboxes, etc. — you can bet that JavaScript is probably involved. It is the third layer of the layer cake of standard web technologies, two of which (HTML and CSS).
4.	Bootstrap: - Bootstrap is the most popular HTML, CSS and JavaScript framework for developing a responsive and mobile friendly website. It is absolutely free to download and use.It is a front-end framework used for easier and faster web development. It includes HTML and CSS based design templates for typography, forms, buttons, tables, navigation, modals, image carousels and many others.It can also use JavaScript plug-ins. It facilitates you to create responsive designs.
5.	Database: - A database is an organized collection of data, so that it can be easily accessed and managed. You can organize data into tables, rows, columns, and index it to make it easier to find relevant information. Database handlers create a database in such a way that only one set of software program provides access of data to all the users. The main purpose of the database is to operate a large amount of information by storing, retrieving, and managing data.There are many dynamic websites on the World Wide Web nowadays which are handled through databases. For example, a model that checks the availability of rooms in a hotel. It is an example of a dynamic website that uses a database. There are many databases available like MySQL, Sybase, Oracle, MongoDB, Informix, PostgreSQL, SQL Server, etc.
6.	Python: - Python is an open source, object oriented, high level programming language. Python is a general-purpose programming language. By using python language, you can develop different kinds of applications like desktop applications, web applications, ERP, etc. In project development we use python as main programming language. In this internship program we developed a web-based application named “SmartBuild Hub”, In this web application we used Python with the django framework. 
7.	Django Framework: - Django is a web framework developed by using powerful python programming language. It follows MVT architecture.
